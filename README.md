# Firebase Unity Authentication and Database Integration
This repository provides scripts for integrating Google and Anonymous authentication with Unity, along with saving login data to Firebase.

## First Steps
1. Add the `google-signin-plugin` to your Unity project. Prior to adding the plugin, ensure the "Parse" and "PlayServicesResolver" options in the package are unchecked.
2. Go to the Firebase console and create a new project. Add the `google-services.json` file generated by Firebase to your Unity project.
3. Import the `Firebase.Auth` and `Firebase.Database` packages into your Unity project.

In this repository, you'll find scripts that handle authentication via Google and anonymously. Both scripts will save the user's last login date.

Note: Google authentication does not work directly within the Unity editor; you must build the project and test it on a physical device or an emulator.

Before testing on a device, you need to configure the Firebase web client ID in your code and also generate your project's SHA-1 to add to Firebase for Google's certificate.

### How to Retrieve the Web Client ID:
- To obtain the web client ID, navigate to the Firebase console, select the sign-in method tab, and enable Google authentication.
- In the Google sign-in method configuration, locate the "Web SDK configuration" section. You will find the "Web Client ID" there, which should be inserted into the `GoogleWebAPI` variable in the script.

### How to Generate SHA-1:
- To generate the SHA-1 certificate, first create a "Keystore" in Unity and save it.
- Open the command prompt and execute the following command, replacing the path and alias with your own:
keytool -list -v -keystore "C:\path\to\your\keystore" -alias your_alias
- Take the SHA-1 code that is generated and go to the Firebase project settings.
- Add it to the "SHA certificate fingerprints" section.
